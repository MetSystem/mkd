Windows app that combines different APIs (iFlytek-科大讯飞, Google Translate, Bing Speech, Baidu Translate) to get the best translating captioning for China market:

1. For a speaker that talks in Chinese and requires English captioning on the screen we use:
  Chinese voice recognition (iFlytek-科大讯飞) + Chinese to English translation (Google Translate)

2. For a speaker that talks in English and requires Chinese captioning on the screen we use:
  English voice recognition (Bing Speech) + English to Chinese translation (Baidu Translate)


Open to any suggestion! Thanks!!
