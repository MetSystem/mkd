All in one. A windows app that combines different APIs (iFlytek-科大讯飞, Google, Microsoft, Baidu) to get the best translating captioning for China market:

1. For a speaker that talks in Chinese and requires English captioning on the screen we use:
  Chinese voice recognition (iFlytek-科大讯飞) + Chinese to English translation (Google)

2. For a speaker that talks in English and requires Chinese captioning on the screen we use:
  English voice recognition (Microsoft) + English to Chinese translation (Baidu)


Open to any suggestion! Thanks!!
